# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Extracting data from a SQL database.
Cleaning, transforming and analyzing data.
Loading data into a database.
Developing and implementing a QA process to validate transformed data against raw data.

## Process
### Database creation, table 
### Data cleaning

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you use the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
1. Initial challenges importing .csv tables in PgAdmin. I navigated this by changing the dir of the table files to the pgAdmin folder on my computer.

## Future Goals
I would have spent more time cleaning the data if there was more time on the project.
